The files are temporarily in spanish,they will be completely in English in the near future.

You can find (only dynamic implementations, static ones where worked in class but i don't want to put them here):

Queue : simple and circular.

Stack : simple and circualr.

List  : double linked, simple linked, and simple linked circular.

Binary tree.

Basic recursive functions: like binary search, reverse string, etc.

Some exercises worked in class like a math expression debugger, it tells you if you miss something like a ([{ or }]) in a bunch of math expressions read from a txt file, there you can find a bank queue basic simulator, it calculates the time that a queue gets empty 5 times and how many people where attended, etc.
